The solution uses the concept of subsets and their relation to the number of elements in a set. It calculates the total number of divisors of 72 using its prime factorization, then determines the number of composite divisors by excluding 1, 2, and 3. The solution then applies the formula for the number of subsets, which is 2^n, where n is the number of composite divisors. I will follow the same steps to validate the solution. First, I will calculate the total number of divisors of 72 using its prime factorization. The prime factorization of 72 is 2^3 * 3^2. To find the total number of divisors, I will use the formula (a+1)(b+1), where a and b are the exponents of the prime factors. In this case, a = 3 and b = 2. Therefore, the total number of divisors is (3+1)(2+1) = 12. Next, I will determine the number of composite divisors by excluding 1, 2, and 3. Since 1 is neither prime nor composite, and 2 and 3 are prime, the remaining divisors are composite. Therefore, the number of composite divisors is 12 - 3 = 9. Finally, I will apply the formula for the number of subsets, which is 2^n, where n is the number of composite divisors. In this case, n = 9, so the number of subsets is 2^9 = 512.
